# uP-Group-Project

Groups will be assigned marks for each design module considered. In each design module, groups should indicate the related application requirements, specify the hardware and software interfaces chosen for the project, and then write a short critique/justiﬁcation for the choice of interface(s). Application requirements should be linked to the functional requirements of your peripheral module using a traceability table. Interface speciﬁcations should include circuit diagrams, ﬂowcharts and/or pseudo code, and document all design decisions/calculations. Your critique should consider the history of problem, review your logic/reasoning, examine feasibility of solution and weigh the impact of solution on the application. Each of these should be on a separate wiki page.
